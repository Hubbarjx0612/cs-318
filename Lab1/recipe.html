            <img src="images/pasta.jpg" alt="Bowl of Lemon Chicken Pasta" width="500">
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced into cutlet</li>
                    <li>1 lb. pasta of choice </li>
                    <li>6 garlic cloves, mincedn</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp. lemon zest plus 3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, prepare chicken. Place chicken in a bowl and combine with olive oil, lemon zest, and spices. Toss well to thoroughly coat both sides of chicken in seasoning. Heat a large high-sided skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Arrange chicken in pan and cook until nicely golden and internal temperature reaches 165ºF, about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.</li>
                    <li>Prepare sauce. Add butter to the pan (no need to wipe clean) along with chopped yellow onion. Cook over medium heat until the onion softens, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes, until aromatic.</li>
                    <li>Add heavy cream, broth, salt, and black pepper. Bring mixture to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the mixture slightly thickens, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add pasta to the pan with sauce, along with 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water. Increase the heat to medium-high, and toss vigorously with a pair of tongs. Continue cooking and tossing constantly, until the pasta is glossed in a thick sauce, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Thinly slice chicken and place on top of the pasta. Garnish with extra chopped fresh parsley, grated Parmesan, cracked black pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
